# CargoHub Software Development Project

## Overview

Welcome to the CargoHub project! This initiative involves the development and enhancement of software acquired from our new client, CargoHub, a company specializing in the handling and storage of goods. The existing software has an API that supports various applications for centralized data processing and critical process flows.

## Project Background

Recently, we took on CargoHub as a new client. The software provided to us is essential for their operations; however, it lacks adequate documentation and crucial components such as tests, repositories, and reports. The previous development team is no longer active, leaving us without any support for understanding the softwareâ€™s functionalities.

As the current development team, we are tasked with:

1. Mapping out the software's requirements.
2. Documenting the functionalities and processes.
3. Testing the software for sufficient coverage.
4. Verifying requirements with CargoHub to ensure all needs are met.
5. Identifying and incorporating any new requirements.

## Goals

To ensure a successful project, we aim to:

- Establish a clear understanding of the existing software and its capabilities.
- Develop comprehensive documentation to aid current and future development efforts.
- Implement a robust testing strategy to verify software functionality and coverage.
- Set up standardized software development processes.

## Development Process

To facilitate our work on this project, we will set up the following:

- **Repository**: Create a version-controlled repository to manage our codebase.
- **Project Software**: Establish the necessary software stack and frameworks for development.
- **Testing Environment**: Configure a dedicated environment for testing to ensure quality assurance.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Implement CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment processes.

## Next Steps

1. **Requirement Mapping**: Begin mapping out existing requirements based on the current software capabilities.
2. **Documentation**: Create detailed documentation to describe functionalities, processes, and any identified issues.
3. **Testing Strategy**: Develop a testing strategy that includes unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance tests.
4. **Regular Meetings**: Schedule regular check-ins with CargoHub to verify requirements and gather feedback.

## Conclusion

The CargoHub project presents an exciting opportunity to enhance our software development skills while delivering value to our client.
