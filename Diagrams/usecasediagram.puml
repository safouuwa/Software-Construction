|= Use Case Description |
| The CargoHub system implements CRUD 
(Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations 
for various entities within the warehouse 
management system. Each use case typically 
includes standard CRUD endpoints (Get, 
Post, Put, Delete) as well as specialized 
endpoints like GetSingle for retrieving 
individual records.

Additional unique endpoints may include:
- Search functionality for complex queries
- Bulk operations for efficiency
- Status updates (e.g., commit orders, 
  ship items)
- Relationship management (e.g., linking 
  orders to shipments)

Actors:
- Admin: Has full access to all operations 
  across all use cases
- Warehouse Manager: Has varied access 
  levels depending on the specific use 
  case, generally focused on day-to-day 
  warehouse operations

The system is designed to provide 
comprehensive management of warehouse 
operations, from inventory and order 
management to shipment tracking and 
supplier relations. |
